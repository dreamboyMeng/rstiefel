\title{Gibbs Sampling for the Matrix-variate Bingham-von Mises-Fisher Distribution.
Simulate from the matrix bmf distribution as described in Hoff(2009).}
\usage{
rbmf.matrix.gibbs(A, B, C, X)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A symmetric matrix.}

\item{B}{A diagonal matrix with decreasing entries.}

\item{C}{A matrix with the same dimension as X.}

\item{X}{The current value of the random orthonormal matrix.}
}
\value{
A new value of the matrix \code{X} obtained by Gibbs sampling.
}
\description{
Gibbs Sampling for the Matrix-variate Bingham-von Mises-Fisher Distribution.
Simulate from the matrix bmf distribution as described in Hoff(2009).
}
\note{
This provides one Gibbs scan. The function should be used iteratively.    
WARNING: - do not start X at the eigenvectors of A: The relative weights on A then can become infinity.
